# COVID-VACCINES-ANALYSIS
Analyzes COVID-19 vaccine uptake across Kenya’s counties using MoH data to identify trends, disparities, and underserved regions. Uses Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau to support public health planning and equitable vaccine distribution.

📊**COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake and Equity Analysis in Kenya**

🔎 **Problem Statement**

Despite national efforts to vaccinate the population against COVID-19, vaccination uptake in Kenya has been uneven across counties. Disparities exist between rural and urban regions, age groups, and genders. These inequities hinder the country’s progress toward herd immunity, protect vulnerable populations less effectively, and complicate efficient vaccine allocation.

Furthermore, a lack of real-time, data-driven analysis limits targeted interventions by hospitals, NGOs, and government agencies. This project provides actionable insights into these disparities using official data from the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH).

🎯 **Project Objectives**
Determine the overall COVID-19 vaccination rate across Kenya

Identify counties with the highest and lowest uptake

Evaluate vaccine uptake variation by gender or age (if demographic data is available)

Assess geographic and demographic inequities in vaccine distribution

Analyze trends in vaccine uptake across Kenya’s 47 counties over time

Compare vaccination rates between rural vs. urban counties

Break down uptake by dose type (1st, 2nd, booster)

Identify counties lagging in booster coverage

Highlight underserved or under-vaccinated population groups

Provide data-driven recommendations for public health outreach

🗂️ **Data Source**
Ministry of Health Kenya (MoH)
Use Daily Situation Reports and Vaccination Updates from the Newsroom or Publications sections.

Key Data Points Include:

Daily and cumulative vaccine doses administered

County-level breakdown

Dose type (1st, 2nd, booster)

Occasionally includes gender and age demographics

🧰 **Tools Used**
Tool	Purpose
Excel	Data cleaning, summarization, pivot tables
Python	(pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for trend analysis and visuals
SQL	Query vaccine data, join with population/health data
Tableau	Interactive dashboards and geographic visualization

📊 **Key Analyses to Perform**
1. County-Level Uptake Trends
Line graphs showing vaccination rates over time

Choropleth maps for county-level coverage

2. Equity Analysis
Compare rural vs. urban vaccination rates

Correlate uptake with population size and health facility access

3. Dose Type Analysis
Breakdown of 1st, 2nd, and booster doses

Visualize booster dose lag across counties

4. Demographic Analysis (if available)
Gender and age distribution of vaccinated individuals

Identify underserved groups

5. Public Health Insights
Highlight counties below national average

Recommend priority areas for intervention (NGOs, hospitals, MoH)

📈 Tableau Dashboard Ideas
